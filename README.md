# DS-210-Final-Project-

In this project, I took a Twitch Social network dataset provided by Kaggle and cleaned it, I made edges for the data set as I cleaned it and replaced its labels. Then I used Rust  to create a graph and apply the PageRank algorithm to identify the top 100 nodes. Then with these top 100 nodes, I created a new graph with these specific nodes and used depth-first search to find the shortest path, but realized that breath first search is the algorithm that should be utilized. Overall, this analysis allowed me to effectively reduce the complexity of the original dataset and gain a better understanding of the connections within the Twitch network. This information can be useful for customer analysis in Twitchâ€™s marketing strategy.
